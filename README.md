# FriendFinder
[Try the application ](https://warm-sands-98393.herokuapp.com/)
FriendFinder matches the user with a potential 'friend' based on how similarly they score on the survey. The friend with the closest value to the user will be the winning match. The user will see the recommendation pop onto the screen with Bootstrap's modal functionality.  

### Getting Started
To begin, I would create the 10 question survey (and each question must be a scale from 1 to 5(1 being least likely, 5 being most likely) or however you prefer to set up your questions. The questions must have a uniform feel with the way the user is inputting the data. Open-ended questions, text answers or any question that does not fit the numeric scale format will skew the results or will stop the application from finishing the program and pairing the user with a new friend. 

I used bootstrap's form to quickly create my questions, scale and submit button on my survey.html file.
